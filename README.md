Portfolio Valuation and Forecasting
Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting loan repayments and valuing a portfolio based on historical data and assumptions. It involves calculating historical repayment percentages, forecasting future repayments, and deriving the present value of the portfolio using a discount rate. The goal is to compare the computed portfolio value with the client’s estimate and determine whether the difference is acceptable.

Key Features
Analyze historical loan repayment data.
Forecast future repayment percentages using a mathematical model.
Calculate the present value of forecasted cash flows with a discount rate.
Compare the computed portfolio value with the client’s estimate.
Export results to a CSV file for further analysis.
